# MicrobeHatProject
Goal: Using fashion to create microbial science communication and education hats

Fashion can be used to spark conversations and engage curiosity- two keys to effective science communication. 
The Microbe Hat Project was created in 2019, by microbiologist Anne A. Madden as a way of creatively engaging the public with the science of microbes.

The first sets of hats created featured scaled-up 3D printed microorganisms adorning derby-style hats. Each hat acted as a conversation starter to discuss the science of the microbe displayed, as well as introduce broader science themes such as global climate change, antibiotic resistance, and microbial ecology. These hats have been featured on the TED stage and have been accepted into the collections of the world's largest hat museums.

Based on the success, this guide was created so that educators and the general public could create their own hats and use them to communicate microbial science. Such communication is key now more than ever in the face of the general defunding of research science, the rise of antibiotic resistance, climate change, and the current mass loss of species. 

The following documents provide a guide to creating your own microbe hats to assist with using data-driven principals for communicating science. 

The guide consists of 1. Selecting a microbe to 3D print. 2. Learning about that microbe. 3. Writing a brief 'story' that you want to communicate about that microbe. 4. Finding a hat and supplies to help convey that story. 5. Examples.

Please share this project, and your creations, with the hashtag #MicrobeHatProject.

Thank you!
